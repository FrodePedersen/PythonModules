Right now:  Can only detect things that are defined in root
            Can only detect imported modules that are written as "import 'name'"

missing import checks:
            Needs to be able to find "from module import function" imports
            Needs to be able to find "from module import class" imports


way of fixing:
            Crawl the bloody .py files instead of importing meta info
